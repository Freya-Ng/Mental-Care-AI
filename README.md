## Mental Health Support System using RAG and LlamaIndex

## Project Overview
This project is in the **brainstorming** and **early concept** phase, exploring the potential for a smart mental health support system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LlamaIndex. The system aims to provide virtual counseling, assist in diagnostics based on DSM-5, and track users' mental health progress.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create and Activate a Conda Environment

```sh
conda create -n aio_env python=3.11
conda activate aio_env
```

### 2. Set Up OpenAI API Key

Create a `.streamlit` folder in the root directory, and add a `secrets.toml` file:

```toml
[openai]
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-api-key"
```

### 3. Install Required Libraries

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application Locally

```sh
streamlit run Home.py
```

## Docker Setup

### 1. Building the Docker Image

To containerize the application, use:

```sh
docker build -t mental-care-ai .
```

### 2. Running the Docker Container

Run the container, mapping port `8501` to access the Streamlit app:

```sh
docker run -p 8501:8501 mental-care-ai
```

### 3. Managing Secrets in Docker

To securely pass your OpenAI API key:

- **Option 1:** Use an environment variable when running the container:

  ```sh
  docker run -p 8501:8501 -e OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key" mental-care-ai
  ```

- **Option 2:** Use a `.env` file:

  ```plaintext
  # .env file
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key
  ```

  Then run the container with:

  ```sh
  docker run -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env mental-care-ai
  ```

## Current Focus
Defining the problem and outlining the methodology:

1. **Concept and Motivation**
   - Addressing the need for accessible mental health support.
   - Exploring LlamaIndex for a virtual mental health assistant.

2. **Initial Methodology**
   - Using LlamaIndex to retrieve DSM-5-related information.
   - Designing agents to track user conversations and provide feedback.

## Next Steps
Refining ideas and developing a pipeline for mental health diagnostics.

## Contributions and Ideas
Since this is an ongoing project, contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcomed.

## License
To be determined as the project evolves.
