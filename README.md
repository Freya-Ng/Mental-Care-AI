## Mental Health Support System using RAG and LlamaIndex

## Project Overview
This project is currently in the **brainstorming** and **early concept** phase. Our goal is to explore the possibility of creating a smart mental health support system utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LlamaIndex. The system aims to provide virtual counseling services, assist in mental health diagnostics based on DSM-5, and track users' mental health progress over time.

## Current Focus
At this stage, the focus is on defining the problem and outlining the methodology. The project is not fully developed yet, and most ideas are still under discussion and refinement.

1. **Concept and Motivation**
   - Exploring the need for accessible, affordable mental health support, especially in regions like Vietnam where mental health services are limited.
   - Investigating how technology, especially language models like LlamaIndex, can be leveraged to build a virtual mental health assistant capable of diagnosing and providing support.

2. **Initial Methodology**
   - Discussing the potential use of LlamaIndex to retrieve mental health-related information from DSM-5 and other reliable sources.
   - Exploring how agents could be designed to track conversation history, assess mental health conditions, and provide personalized feedback to users.

## Next Steps
Since the project is in its infancy, we will continue to refine the ideas and methodologies. No concrete implementations have been developed yet, but future directions include setting up a basic pipeline for mental health diagnostics and experimenting with agent-based systems.

## Contributions and Ideas
Since this is an ongoing brainstorming project, we welcome any contributions, feedback, or suggestions as we work towards a clearer direction and actionable development plan.
