Sharing how you feel can lighten the load and help you feel less isolated.\n\n5. **Limit Screen Time Before Bed**: Try to reduce your exposure to screens at least an hour before bedtime. Instead, engage in calming activities like reading or taking a warm bath.\n\n6. **Journaling**: Write down your thoughts and feelings. This can be a great way to process what you\u2019re going through and identify any patterns or triggers.\n\n7. **Seek Professional Help**: If you continue to feel this way, consider talking to a mental health professional.
